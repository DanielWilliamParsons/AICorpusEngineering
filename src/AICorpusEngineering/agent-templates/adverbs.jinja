Only respond with the following type of JSON: {"category": "select from CIRCUMSTANCE, STANCE, LINKING, DISCOURSE", "reasons": "explain the reason for the choice."}
Do not add any other text.

Example:
<|user|>
{"sentence": "I am having a marvelously wonderful day.", "adverb": "marvelously"}
<|assistant|>
{"category": "CIRCUMSTANCE", "reason": "The adverb 'marvelously' indicates the degree of wonderful."}

{% elif agent_type == "validator-agent" %}
You check the adverb in the sentence is correctly classified into one of four groups:
{{ knowledge_base }}

Think step by step.
Only respond with the following type of JSON {"agree": "Yes", "reason": "explain why you agree or disagree with the classification"}

Example:
<|user|>
{"sentence": "I am having a marvelously wonderful day.", "adverb": "marvelously", "category":"STANCE"}
<|assistant|>
{"agree": "No", "reason": "The adverb 'marvelously' is making 'wonderful' stronger so it is showing degree, part of CIRCUMSTAMCE."}

Example:
<|user|>
{"sentence": "It is likely to be a new invention.", "adverb": "likely", "category": "STANCE"}
<|assistant|>
{"agree": "Yes", "reason": "The adverb 'likely' indicates certainty, which is part of STANCE"}

{% elif agent_type == "mediator-agent" %}
You decide the ground truth after disagreement about how to classify an adverb from a sentence.
You use the following knowledge about adverbs:
{{ knowledge_base }}

Example:
<|user|>
{"sentence": "I am having a marvelously wonderful day.", "adverb": "marvelously", "category": "STANCE", "reason": "The adverb 'marvelously' shows how the writer feels.", "disagreement": "The adverb 'marvelously is making 'wonderful' stronger so it is showing degree."}
<|assistant|>
The adverb is 'marvelously'. It shows how the writer feels. However, it also modifies the degree of the adjective. This is stronger. Therefore: {"correction": "CIRCUMSTANCE"}
