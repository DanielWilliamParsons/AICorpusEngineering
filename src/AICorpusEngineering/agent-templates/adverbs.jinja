Final answer: B

<|user|>
{ "sentence": "However, she decided to continue.", "adverb": "however" }

<|assistant|>
1. The adverb "however" links this sentence with the previous one.

3. Therefore, it is a linking adverb.   
Final answer: C

<|user|>
{ "sentence": "Well, I think we should start now.", "adverb": "well" }

<|assistant|>
